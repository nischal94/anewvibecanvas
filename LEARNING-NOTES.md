# My Learning Notes

  ## What I Learned Today:

  ### Git & GitHub:
  - Branches create parallel versions of code
  - Pull requests are proposals to merge changes
  - Option 1 = Direct commit (skip PR)
  - Option 2 = Create PR (proper workflow!)

  ### Important:
  Always use **Option 2** when you want others to review your code!
